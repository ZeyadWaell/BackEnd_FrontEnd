## Overview

ChatApp QRS is a full-stack chat application designed to deliver a seamless user experience through real-time messaging, user authentication, and responsive UI. It consists of a backend server that handles data processing and real-time events and a frontend client that provides an interactive interface for users.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging:** Instant messaging capabilities between users.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration processes.
- **Responsive UI:** Adaptive design for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle high user traffic and maintain performance.
- **Modular Codebase:** Clean separation of concerns for easy maintenance and feature expansion.

## Architecture & Design Patterns

This project leverages several common design patterns to enhance code quality and maintainability:

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)

- **Model:** Manages data and business logic.
- **View:** Handles the presentation layer.
- **Controller:** Bridges the model and view, managing user input and responses.

### Observer Pattern

- **Purpose:** Facilitates real-time communication.
- **Usage:** The system notifies subscribers (e.g., UI components) when new messages arrive or when user statuses change.

### Singleton Pattern

- **Purpose:** Ensure a class has only one instance.
- **Usage:** Used for managing configuration settings and database connections to maintain consistency across the application.

### Factory Pattern

- **Purpose:** Encapsulate object creation.
- **Usage:** Simplifies the creation of various objects like message types or user sessions without exposing the creation logic.

### Strategy Pattern

- **Purpose:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- **Usage:** Enables switching between different algorithms (for example, encryption methods or notification strategies) at runtime.

### Other Notable Patterns

- **Decorator Pattern:** Dynamically adds behaviors to objects, such as enhancing messages with additional metadata.
- **Facade Pattern:** Provides a simplified interface to complex subsystems, making the overall system easier to interact with.
- **Repository Pattern:** Separates data access logic from business logic, ensuring a clean and testable codebase.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A database of your choice (e.g., [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/))

### Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure your environment variables by creating a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example`.

4. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend folder:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
